## Lumi&egrave;re 

[Lumi&egrave;re](http://roberthenke.com/concerts/lumiere.html) is an audio-laser performance by [Robert Henke](http://roberthenke.com/).
Centre of the performance is a laser system emitting extremely bright and complex patterns in real-time to music. A key to his design is the precision of the laser beam. My contribution to this project are mathematical calculations regarding the non-linear movement of the laser beam considering various parameters.

## Deep learning in music


## Haunted Farm 

The haunted farm project is providing its user extended controls over a rather standard toy creating a  unique sound. All that at a very low cost. Easy and cheap encourages disadvantaged groups to first steps into technique and art. Availability is key. 

In particular, we replaced SD components with regular linear and logaritmic resistnces to achieve pitch and volume control (not respectively). Moreover we added a jack out that can be activated via a switch for easy digitalisation although the toy can be usedalonestanding as well.

Project with MAximilian Ilse, 2012

## rootsystem

The rootsytem project...

In the scope of this project I am developing a data driven sensor. The sensor consists of low cost components. Key to it is a complex machine learning based analysed of gathered and labeled data. Unfortunatelly, we have to create a labeld data base our self which is very time consuming. 

Project with Louis Smit, started in 2014
