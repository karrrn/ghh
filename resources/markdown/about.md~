# ABOUT

I am a scientific researcher in the intelligent music processing and machine learning group at the Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence ([OFAI](http://www.ofai.at/research/impml/index.html)). My research focus lies on machine learning. In particular, I am interested in statistical inference, information theory, deep learning, Bayesian methods, graph theory and applications in sequential data (e.g. music, environmental data) and real-time sensoring.
