# ABOUT

I am a PhD student at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by Prof. Max Welling. My research focus lies on machine learning. In particular, I am interested in statistical inference, information theory, deep learning, Bayesian methods, graph theory and finally applications in sequential data (e.g. music, environmental data) and real-time sensoring.
