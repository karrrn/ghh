# Dissolved Carbon Dioxide Sensor

Carbon dioxide is a major player in climate change and plays
an important role in various industrial and medical applications. Thus its ex-
act and efficient measurement is of great importance. In this paper we aim to
develop and present a novel approach to measure CO 2 accurate, concentra-
tion and environment independently and reasonably fast. The new technique
is supposed to satisfy the need for the measurement of high dissolved car-
bon dioxide concentrations. In fact, it is universally applicable to all fluids
including air and water. The design is oriented at the Servinghaus sensor.
Instead of measuring the pH value we record the conductivity. In doing so
greater accuracy can be achieved. It was possible to gain first reliable results.
However, the main drawback of the method so far is its no response time. We
have no doubt that due to the experiences with the Servinghaus electrode a
manufacture could easily decrease the response time with appropriate hoses
that were not available for our study.
