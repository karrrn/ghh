## Haunted Farm 

The haunted farm project is providing its user extended controls over a rather standard toy creating a  unique sound. All that at a very low cost. Easyly acessable and cheap compounds encourage disadvantaged groups to first steps into technique and art. 

We show an example for which we replaced SD components with regular linear and logaritmic resistnces to achieve pitch and volume control. Moreover we added a jack out that can be activated via a switch for easy digitalisation although the toy can be usedalonestanding as well.
