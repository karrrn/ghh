## Lumi&egrave;re 

[Lumi&egrave;re](http://roberthenke.com/concerts/lumiere.html) is an audio-laser performance by [Robert Henke](http://roberthenke.com/).
Centre of the performance is a laser system emitting extremely bright and complex patterns in real-time to music. A key to his design is the precision of the laser beam. My contribution to this project are mathematical calculations regarding the non-linear movement of the laser beam considering various parameters.
