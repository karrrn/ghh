## rootsystem

Hydroponics is a way of growing plants that avoids soil and tailors the amount of nutrients a plant
needs specifically to it. This a much more efficient way of farming, one which many DIY enthusiasts
have embraced and is also finding its way into the
urban farming movement. Not only does it save 90% of the water traditional farming uses, the crops produce much higher yields.

The problem with hydroponics is the research and knowledge required to get started. There are quite a
few variables involved that influence your results. This is a pity, since it can be the most hands off way of getting fresh fruit and vegetables. This stems from the fact the environment can be closely
controlled and monitored.

The rootsystem project  wants to make hydroponics culture accessible to a lager community and therefore we develop tools and kits for easy success.

In the scope of this project I am developing a data driven sensor. The sensor consists of low cost components. Key to it is a complex machine learning based analyse of  gathered and labeled data. Unfortunately, we have to create a labeled data base our self which is very time consuming.
