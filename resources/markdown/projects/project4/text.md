## Haunted farm 

The haunted farm project is providing its user extended control over a rather standard piano toy resulting in unique sounds. It is a simple example of circuit-bending.  We only use easily accessible and cheap compounds. In this way, we hope to encourage more people of all ages to make first steps into technique and art. 

We show an example, in which we replaced SD components with regular linear and logarithmic resistances to achieve pitch and volume control. Moreover, we added a jack-out that can be activated via a switch to easily record the signal although the toy can be used alone standing as well.
