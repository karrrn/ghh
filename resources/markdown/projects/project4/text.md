## Haunted Farm 

The haunted farm project is providing its user extended controls over a rather standard piano toy resulting in unique sounds. It is a simple example of circuit-bending.  We only use easily accessible and cheap compounds. In this way we hope to encourage more people of all ages to first steps into technique and art. 

We show an example for which we replaced SD components with regular linear and logarithmic resistances to achieve pitch and volume control. Moreover we added a jack out that can be activated via a switch for easy digitization although the toy can be used alone standing as well.
