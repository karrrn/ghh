# Dissolved carbon dioxide sensor

Carbon dioxide is a major player in climate change and is crucial in various industrial and medical applications. Thus, its exact and efficient measurement is of great importance. 
In the scope of my bachelor thesis I  developed  a novel approach to measuring dissolved carbon dioxide in water. 
The new technique was tailored to satisfy the need for the measurement of high dissolved carbon dioxide concentrations. 
In the end, the design turned out to be universally applicable to all fluids including air and water. 
The main idea was to record the conductivity instead of measuring the pH value. In doing so greater accuracy can be achieved. It was possible to gain first reliable results.
