# Goethe in my Mind

We trained a sylable based RNN on poetry of German classics such as Goethe and Schiller, furthermore the corpus was subplemented by ganster rappers like Bushido, KIZ and Kollegah.
We presented the result at the [chaos communication camp 2015](https://media.ccc.de/v/camp2015-6787-goethe_in_my_mind).
